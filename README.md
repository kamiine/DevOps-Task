# Devops-parity !

Let's show the automation of the provisioning and deployment process of deploying a substrate network. 

# First step: Docker Compose

I used docker-compose to deploy instances of Prometheus, Grafana and Substrate Network. 
> To start docker compose file: 
		sudo docker-compose up -d 

## Second step: Monitoring

Now let's use scrapped metrics generated by prometheus and show them with grafana dashboards: 
I used [this dashboard]([https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11784) for visualizing the substrate node metrics.

## 3rd Step: Kubernetes

I used the [Kompose]((https://kompose.io/)) command in order to convert the docker-compose file to kubernetes files. The result is in the kubernetes-files folder. 
As I don't have to a public server, I couldn't deploy the kubernetes cluster but the files generated should be enough to deploy a cluster using 
```bash
 kompose convert -o kubernetes-files/
 kompose up 
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-files/substrate-node-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-files/prometheus-node-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-files/grafana-node-deployment.yaml

```
